Namespace:

Namespaces in C++ are used to organize too many classes so that it can be easy to handle the application.

For accessing the class of a namespace, we need to use namespacename::classname. We can use using keyword so that we 
don't have to use complete name all the time.

In C++, global namespace is the root namespace. The global::std will always refer to the namespace "std" of C++ Framework.

The simple example in the file example1.cpp clearly shows the use of namespace with variables and functions.
